# Documentation Overview[¶](#executive-summary "Permanent link")

This document provides a comprehensive overview of VIA's Zero Trust Fabric (ZTF), a security solution designed for user authentication, network access, and secure information sharing in enterprise environments. It is intended to serve as an in-depth guide for understanding the ZTF system, its core components, and its operational requirements.

The ZTF architecture is built on the principle of "never trust, always verify," moving beyond traditional perimeter-based security to protect against modern threats. The solution provides a decentralized, passwordless, and quantum-resistant authentication framework. Key sections of the document detail ZTF's core components—Verifiable Credentials (VC), the Issuer, the Verifier, the VIA Wallet, and the Decentralized Identity (DID) Registry.

The documentation includes user flow examples for both registration and login, illustrating how the system integrates with existing identity management systems like Keycloak. The appendices provide further technical details on topics such as secure logout procedures, Helm chart configurations for Keycloak integration, and the usage of the WalletConnectService. This information is critical for developers and administrators tasked with implementing and developing applications that utilize VIA ZTF.
